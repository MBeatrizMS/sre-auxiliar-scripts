If you write a script in VS Code you do not need to open a terminal to run it. You can hit the green play button  in the top right corner and it will automatically open a terminal and run the script for you.

If you are using Linux or Mac you can start your scripts with the line:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
This is known as a "shebang" and if you make your script executable, e.g., with chmod u+x tell_time.py you can then just run it in the terminal with ./tell_time.py, rather than having to type python tell_time.py.
